3. Canvas

4. YouTube
  Link - https://www.youtube.com/

5. Instagram
  Link - https://www.instagram.com/
  Pros - Navigation bar with relevant options
  Cons - Scrolling feed in non-chronological order, layout seemingly for mobile design rather than desktop, ads/unrelevant items in the feed that cannot be removed
  Improvements - An overhaul of the Instagram web app to fit the desktop layout would be needed, as the website seems like an afterthought compared to the mobile application.
