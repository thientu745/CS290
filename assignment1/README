Beginning to go to the gym can be a difficult task, with so many machines, and people knowing where to start can pose a challenge. To combat this, many people start by
getting an introduction, some friend, which helps them learn the ropes and what to-do. This is a high barrier to entry, one which can lead to problems in all areas. Without an
introduction, the gym can be a scary place and even dangerous place. Using weights improperly can lead to decreases in both efficiency and safety, both of which are
detrimental to user experience. Working out in general has benefits both for physical and mental health, so limited access to the activity denies these benefits to a subsection
of the population who would go to the gym otherwise. From my own experience, it can be hard to know intuitively what should be done first. Other areas that are essential to
working out: diet, resting and technique are all things that canâ€™t be learned from the gym. Our proposed application should allow new or continuing gym-goers to confidently
use all the facilities offered in a gym. It should make the oftentimes daunting and/or overwhelming experience of blindly going into the gym a more manageable task. The
users of the application should be able to sort through specific workouts and exercises. These should be able to be filtered through user-specified parameters such as workout
goals, workout duration, specific muscles, etc.. Descriptions of each workout/exercise will be returned to the user with information about which muscles are being targeted,
tips/tricks for the exercise, a short demonstration of how to perform the exercise, etc.. Additional information such as rest, diet, supplements, and more will also be included.
These features will ensure that the user is able to easily find the information that theyneed, whether they are planning out a gym trip beforehand or attempting to learn a new
exercise on the spot.
