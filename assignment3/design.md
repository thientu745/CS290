A design for a web app that could be useful for me is a portfolio website. This would allow me to tell people about myself, showcase my past projects, and put links to other important sites (LinkedIn, etc.). This would be helpful when
applying for internships, jobs, and more. An idea to make this useful to more people than just myself is a web app that allows you to submit your resume and converts it into a custom portfolio website for you. It would take from the elements
of your resume and present it in a more readable and visually appealing manner.
