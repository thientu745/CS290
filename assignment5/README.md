A design for a web application that I would use is a website that helps a user narrow down choices of where to get food. Too often do my friends and I spend too much time to choose where to get food when we're hanging out.
This web app could be a solution to this, letting you filter by what's open at what time, type of cuisine, price range, calories/macros (protein, carbs, fat, etc.), and more. This would greatly reduce the amount of bickering
that happens when we decide where to eat. This website might have to call the Google Maps API to help with functionalities.
