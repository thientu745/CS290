The design of this website is very similar to the design in Assignment 1. I have built upon what was already made in Assignment 1. Starting to go to the gym/workout can be a very overwhelming and daunting task, making it difficult for people to gain the courage to begin their journey. The purpose of this website is to provide users with information of how to start the workout journey and to make them feel more at ease about starting. This includes information of how to perform exercises (with diagrams, comments on form/technique, tips on safety, etc.), what exercises need to be done to target specific muscle groups, what nutrition should look like, how many times you should be going to the gym, and more! This site attempts to implement a number of these things in the Popular Exercises and Frequently Asked Questions pages of the site. The Gym Calculations page provides some potentially useful calculations in fitness, such as calculating your Body Mass Index (BMI) range and tracking your total calorie consumption. The Gym Nears Me page is aimed to provide a list of gyms close to the user's current location, but it can only provide the location of the Dixon Recreation Center (which is likely the closest gym if you're going to OSU!).

There might be some additional steps needed to run the programs in this assignment. First, you need to ensure Flask is installed. You can do this by typing "pip install flask" into the terminal. To run the program, type and enter "python app.py" into the terminal. Then, you can either go to http://localhost:5000/ or click the link in the terminal to get to the website. 

1. Amazon - Like I said earlier in the term, Amazon's design is very cluttered and could likely be overwhelming to some. Having user options to reduce or adjust the amount of items on the screen would help greatly with this.

2. Monkeytype - Monkeytype's functionality is one-dimensional in that it only allows users to perform speed tests. Broadening the app's capabilities could draw more users to the app (i.e. people learning to type choosing a learning functionality).

3. Canvas - Design seems very dated. More modern design elements could be adopted (more minimalistic, rounded edges, etc.)

4. Youtube - Similar to Amazon, its design is very cluttered and can be overwhelming. Letting users choose how many items are shown at once would help greatly.

5. Instagram - Design changes need to be made to the web app to better reflect the screen sizes that would use it (laptops, PCs, larger tablets, etc.). The design is clearly more catered towards mobile usage.

Assignment 1 - My initial design was very basic, with no CSS. However, it served as a good basis for the coming assignments.

Assignment 2 - This is where the design started to kick in. The website is more visually appealling than its predecessor. However, there is a lack of functionality in this.

Assignment 3 - The exercise library page was a bit of a mess. My primary aim was to complete the assignment requirements, meaning that the elements on the page were a bit ugly.

Assignment 4 - I thought this assignment was actually pretty cool. Applying coding knowledge that I gained from other classes to make my website have additional functionalities was interesting to me.

Assignment 5 - Similar to Assignment 4, I found coding this assignment pretty interesting. Running a website off a local server sounds super cool to me, and is something I never thought I would learn to do. It also let me have an easy time implementing the server-side implementation on my final.
