The design of this website is very similar to the design in Assignment 1. I have built upon what was already made in Assignment 1. Starting to go to the gym/workout can be a very overwhelming and daunting task, making it difficult for people to gain the courage to begin their journey. The purpose of this website is to provide users with information of how to start the workout journey and to make them feel more at ease about starting. This includes information of how to perform exercises (with diagrams, comments on form/technique, tips on safety, etc.), what exercises need to be done to target specific muscle groups, what nutrition should look like, how many times you should be going to the gym, and more! This site attempts to implement a number of these things in the Popular Exercises and Frequently Asked Questions pages of the site. The Gym Calculations page provides some potentially useful calculations in fitness, such as calculating your Body Mass Index (BMI) range and tracking your total calorie consumption. The Gym Nears Me page is aimed to provide a list of gyms close to the user's current location, but it can only provide the location of the Dixon Recreation Center (which is likely the closest gym if you're going to OSU!).
