            <li>Bench Press</li>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/benchpress.jpg') }}" alt="Diagram of bench press form" width="296" height="296">
            <p>The bench press is a compound exercise primarily targeting the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Lie on a flat bench 
                with feet planted, grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width, and lower it towards the chest while keeping elbows at a 45-degree angle. Press 
                the barbell back up explosively, exhaling as you do so. Maintain a neutral spine, use a spotter for safety, and vary grip width to target different areas 
                of the chest and shoulders. Progressively overload with heavier weights over time while incorporating variations like incline or decline bench press for 
                a well-rounded upper body workout routine.</p>
            <li>Back Squat</li>

            <p>
                The back squat is a compound exercise primarily targeting the lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, along with the core and back 
                muscles for stabilization. Begin with the barbell positioned across the back of your shoulders, resting on the upper traps or rear deltoids, and your feet 
                shoulder-width apart. Descend by bending at the knees and hips, keeping the chest up and back straight, until the thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below. 
                Press through the heels to return to the starting position, maintaining proper form throughout the movement. Ensure knees track in line with toes and avoid leaning too 
                far forward or rounding the lower back to prevent injury. Gradually increase weight while maintaining control and stability, and consider incorporating variations like 
                front squats or split squats for overall lower body development.
            </p>
            <li>Deadlift</li>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/deadlift.jpg') }}" alt="Diagram of deadlift form" width="450" height="296">
            <p>
                The deadlift is a compound exercise primarily targeting the posterior chain, including the lower back, glutes, hamstrings, and traps, along with the core muscles for 
                stabilization. Begin by standing with feet hip-width apart, toes under the barbell. Hinge at the hips, bending knees slightly, and grip the barbell with hands shoulder-width 
                apart, using either a conventional or sumo stance. Keep the back flat, chest up, and shoulders back as you drive through the heels, lifting the barbell off the ground until 
                standing tall with hips fully extended. Lower the barbell back down under control, maintaining proper form and tension throughout the movement. Avoid rounding the back or 
                jerking the weight, and engage the core to protect the spine. Gradually increase weight while maintaining proper form, and consider incorporating variations like Romanian 
                deadlifts or trap bar deadlifts for overall strength and muscle development.
            </p>
            <li>Bicep Curl</li>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/curl.jpg') }}" alt="Diagram of bicep curl form" width="357" height="323">
            <p>
                The bicep curl is an isolation exercise primarily targeting the biceps brachii muscles of the upper arms. Start by standing with feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells 
                or a barbell with an underhand grip, arms fully extended and palms facing forward. Keep your elbows close to your sides and exhale as you flex your elbows, curling the weights 
                towards your shoulders while keeping your upper arms stationary. Contract your biceps at the top of the movement, then inhale as you lower the weights back down to the starting 
                position, maintaining control and tension in the muscles throughout the exercise. Avoid swinging the weights or using momentum to lift the weights, and focus on squeezing the 
                biceps at the top of the movement for maximum contraction. Gradually increase weight as you progress and consider incorporating variations like hammer curls or preacher curls to 
                target different areas of the biceps.
            </p>
            <li>Tricep Extension</li>

            <p>
                The tricep extension, also known as the pushdown, is an isolation exercise primarily targeting the triceps brachii muscles of the upper arms. Begin by standing with feet shoulder-width 
                apart, holding a straight or angled bar attachment with an overhand grip, elbows close to your sides, and arms fully extended. Keep your core engaged and exhale as you press the bar 
                downward by extending your elbows, focusing on contracting your triceps. Hold the contraction briefly at the bottom of the movement, then inhale as you return the bar to the starting 
                position with control. Avoid leaning forward or swinging the weight, and keep your upper arms stationary throughout the exercise to isolate the triceps. Gradually increase weight as you 
                progress and consider incorporating variations like rope pushdowns or reverse grip pushdowns for variety in your tricep training routine.
